# Sand

## What is Sand?

Sand is an efficient collection engine for gathering thinking material from people you respect. Just as sand fills a boxing bag to provide resistance for physical training, Sand fills AI thinking partners (like Claude) with authentic perspectives to provide intellectual resistance for mental training.

## Core Concept

When you want to debate with someone's perspective - whether it's Ghuubear, Steve Jobs, or any thinker you admire - you need their actual thoughts, not approximations. Sand collects and processes their real content (tweets, interviews, writings) so your AI thinking partner can authentically push back against your ideas using their genuine perspectives.

## Current Implementation

**Phase 1 (Active):** Collecting ~9,000 tweets from Ghuubear to create the first Sand instance.

**Data Source:** Twitter/X posts via scraping
**Storage:** memory.store for intelligent retrieval and synthesis
**Interface:** Claude with access to processed thinking material

## Purpose

Enable authentic intellectual sparring by giving AI thinking partners real substance to debate with, based on the actual thoughts and perspectives of people whose thinking you value.

## Technical Status

- Data collection: In progress via Claude Code
- Processing pipeline: To be implemented
- Integration with memory.store: Planned
- Testing with Claude: Pending

*Sand is not the thinking partner itself - it's what makes the thinking partner worth sparring with.*
