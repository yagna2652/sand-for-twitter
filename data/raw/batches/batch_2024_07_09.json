      "content": "\"Arjun, quite melancholy, yet to his credit, quite honest, is continuing with a narration of his inner state. He's open-ended; he isn't hiding that which is afflicting him at this moment. It's just no different from what afflicts any other usual mortal. Arjun is just so very normal, yet this honesty, this nakedness, this preparedness to be exposed fully is what separates him from the millions and billions who miss out on a krishna, on a gita.\n\nThis is something to be repeated till it is understood: the uniqueness, the distinction of Arjun lies in his childlike nakedness, his utter simplicity in front of Krishna. There are no games being played here - no tricks, no tactics, no ambiguity, no equivocality. Just a plain, bland expression of feelings, experience, state as it is to Arjun.\n\nArjun does not mind how it looks and sounds. He knows very well the heights that Krishna occupies, the dimensions at which Krishna chooses to perch. It would have been very normal for him to feel awkward, rather ashamed, of describing his usual mortal emotions, feelings, attachments, tendencies to Krishna. He, too, being a learned man, knows very well how purity and philosophy and scriptures look down upon, even condemn, these emotions, etc.\n\nHe knows that he's neither uneducated nor unintelligent. He knows that if he says that he is gripped with fear, stung by moh, or overpowered by asakti, then it is not something that the scholars would praise him for. He knows very well that these are exactly the mental states that have normally been berated and slighted in the Holy books.\n\nIt would have been very easy for him to just pretend that all is well with him, and if he does not want to fight, it is because of some lofty reason. He could have said that he has lately been instructed by some scholar in the pious doctrine of nonviolence, ahimsa, and therefore he has chosen not to pick weapons and not to ever fight any war. He could have easily pretended and tried to mislead Krishna. But that's what most people do.\n\nMost people simply do not have the honesty and, more so, the guts to reveal their interiors, especially to someone who can see through their pretense, call a spade a spade, and not commiserate with them. Most people give a lofty veneer to their usual moral human feelings, intents, and tendencies, don't they?\n\nHardly exists a human being who first of all knows his real intent and secondly, if he knows it, prefers to and dares to disclose it in front of a wise man. We hide, and hiding is something we cannot very often be accused of, because to hide something, first of all, you must know that you have it. We don't even hide; first of all, we lose it. There is a difference between not having something because you have hidden it and not having something because you have forgotten it, lost it, dropped it.\n\nMost people have very little self-knowledge. They do not even know where their feelings, words, and desires are coming from. And if at all they do get an inkling, they get so ashamed morally of their situation that they prefer to be hypocritical about it. \n\nSimply put, they lie.\n\nFor example, if I'm driven by attachment and fear and greed, let's say, chances are I will not even know what my real drivers are. I will not know that I'm acting in such and such ways and moving in such and such direction simply because greed and attachment are ruling me. I will not know. I would rather think to myself, \n\n\"Well, I'm going in that direction because I want to help others, because I do not want confrontation, because I'm peace-loving, or because I want to explore the world or enhance my wisdom,\" \n\nwhen the fact usually would be, as it is with most people most of the time, that one would be driven by one of those very base emotions: fear, greed, lust, anger, envy. That's all; there's nothing more to human drive, human ambition, human desire. There's just nothing more than that. It's just that we give fantastic names to those old primitive tendencies - fantastic, glossy, and very deceptive names.\n\nArjun could have very easily done the same.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/vyQvMdz8z7"

(more on this towards the end of the post.)\n\nlet's explore 1 first.\n\nif a gen-z person is genuinely wanting to commit suicide, they won't say \"i want to kms.\"\n\nthey'll probably say \"i want to kill myself.\" and that too, within a larger conversation that conveys the gravity of the situation.\n\nkms is not the same phrase as \"kill myself\"; it's a meme, and its ironic interpretation is embedded within the context of the culture it's being used in. \n\nwhen i say \"i want to kms\", i'm saying, \n\n\"i'm feeling bad, but don't worry i won't really kill myself.\"\n\nand i know you will interpret it similarly.\n\nlikewise, when i say something is \"toxic\", i don't mean it is life-threatening. \n\nwhich means, as a gen-z fellow, i know how the culture i live within will interpret the word 'toxic' ( it's a meme more than a word), so i don't care if the word was interpreted a lot more strictly just ten years ago.\n\ni'm communicating within the context of the culture i inhabit. which is a more fundamental detail and applies to all generations.\n\n2. in that way, we can say that for \"normies\" in any generation, communication is more about communicating the culture and its low-res maps of reality, and less about precisely communicating one's own experience. \n\ntoday, we have a lot more culture, so we're facing a more extreme version of the phenomenon, where the cultural interpretation and the literal interpretation are poles apart in the level of severity.\n\n\"i want to kill myself\" is a serious statement.\n\"i want to kms\" is a lowkey humorous quip."

Young man,\nit is not your loving, even if your mouth\nwas forced wide open by your own voice — learn\n\nto forget that passionate music.
