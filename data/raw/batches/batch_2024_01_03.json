      "content": "let me share a personal story to provide some context around why i'm such a sucker for professional honesty.\n\nafter working in hardware and web development for a year each, i transitioned to a full-time copywriting position in 2018 at a boutique design studio in mumbai with a 9-person team. i was their only copywriter.\n\nwhile applying, i was impressed by their website and doubted i would hear back from them. had it been any other design agency, i probably wouldn't have. i had no portfolio or experience, just two links: a website i had written copy for during my stint as a django developer and my medium profile with a few blog posts.\n\ni wouldn't have gotten my first big break in a full-time creative writing role if it weren't for ankur rander, the creative director, who spotted my latent talent and trusted me with the position.\n\nbesides his clarity of thought, design philosophy, and the attention to detail and craftsmanship he instilled in me during my year at the studio, two incidents are engraved in my memory.\n\nthe first was when i sent him the communication strategy for a client's website. \n\nas he browsed the deck, he loved the central idea/positioning and reviewed the content samples i had crafted. he pointed out which lines worked and which didn't, noting that many were incompatible with the positioning and created confusion rather than clarity.\n\nafter going through the deck, he turned to me and said something i'll never forget: \n\n\"mustafa, if you have two good lines, only give me those two. never give me 10 for the sake of filling the deck.\"\n\ni learned two things from him that day:\n\n1. never compromise clarity for the sake of optics.\n2. always help the reader build clarity and manage their experience at every step\n\nthe second incident — the more relevant one — occurred when we were working with a pesky client known for bad taste and accepting only mediocre ideas. \n\nthe entire creative team (excluding rander) agreed to give the client what they wanted on the first attempt to save time under a tight deadline.\n\ni remember presenting it to rander over speaker phone, with the team huddled around. and he thrashed me in front of everyone.\n\n\"mustafa, this is really bad work. you have put absolutely no thought into this. please redo it; this is unacceptable.\"\n\ngetting defensive, i explained our reasoning around the client's lack of appetite and why they wouldn't accept something really creative anyway.\n\n\"it doesn't matter what the client will accept. it is our responsibility to suggest what we think is best. if they still don't accept it, we can revise.\"\n\ni learned a crucial lesson that day: never compromise my own work for the sake of someone else's lack of imagination.\n\ni've only become more opinionated and brutal since then, and people who've worked closely with me after that have only loved me for it — although it has been hard for them.\n\nthis isn't toxicity. it's kindness. it's real mentorship. and i wouldn't be where i am today without rander's stick.\n\nto upskill in any real way, the stakes need to be high. if you can't raise them for yourself, you need an absolutely honest person with high standards to push you to raise them. you need to have a clear mirror. or you will never improve.\n\nfin."

      "content": "In reality, there is no relationship between two people at all. There is only a relationship between the image each one has of the other. \n\nWhenever I am talking to you, I am not talking to you, the person standing in front of me right now, I am talking to an image I have of you in my head based on my past interaction. And likewise, with you, you aren't talking to me as a living person standing in front of you right now, but you are talking to an image you have of me in your head. \n\nNow, what happens is the living entity is perpetually in flux, constantly changing and evolving. But since the living entity itself sees itself as an image and not as a living being, they do not realize the constant rift that's forming between the image that is in their head and the person they are constantly evolving into. \n\nSo, this is essentially where stress arises from. It is a conflict between what your real whole self, living self wants to do in this present moment versus what you think you should do based on the image you have of yourself and what you think someone else should do based on the image you have of them. \n\nIn reality, even they are changing constantly moment to moment like you are, but since the images are static, you don't really see or to put it even better, you prevent yourself from seeing the life change that is happening in front of your eyes because your eyes are clouded by the image and not the living entity. \n\nNow, small stresses and rifts between the image and the living entity during daily life can be overcome and are often reconciled by the person. But over a long enough time span, if the image remains sufficiently static and the living entity has wandered far away from that image, what happens is ultimately they will end up doing something that will be a huge shock to their personal image. \n\nThese are moments where if the person in question is your own self, you end up finding out that you aren't the person you always thought you were. And if the person is your spouse or your friend, you similarly end up thinking that you've been betrayed by this person or you always thought they were a certain person but they really weren't. \n\nSo this is the stress and suffering and anxiety that the identity, the image, brings into life. It obscures the life change happening within the person and many a times what can even happen is just to mitigate the stress, the person might suppress their genuine tendencies just to stay true to the image they and others already have about them. \n\nThis, over a long period of time — because the living entity has drifted far apart from the image of the entity — can create psychological neuroses. And this is also why a lot of people require therapy because the image they portray to the world has not really changed in tandem with the living entity, the person behind the image. And over the years, they've suppressed a lot of natural tendencies that would have conflicted with this image.\n\nThis is why they say that the ego is the root of your suffering because the identity is just a complex combination of memes, ideas, images, behaviours, and preferences. But it's a very static thing. It usually does not change quite a lot except on a very superficial layer. For example, you might be hating coffee today and you might start drinking it tomorrow. That is sort of a change that is very easy to justify to others. Hence, such updations can be made easily. \n\nBut a drastic change would be the kind where you've thought you're a good and righteous person all your life, but in a stressful situation, you commit such an evil act that not only are others shocked by your behaviour but you yourself are quite shocked by your own behaviour. Such changes in image are very hard to bring about because they go against everything you have believed about yourself. In truth, what you portray to the world doesn't really exist, it's an abstraction, while your living person is in constant flux with the environment and its genuine impulses and desires are too."
