      "content": "having \"high energy\" is just a euphemism for what is actually a really restless mind that has gathered a lot of momentum. it will create a lot of suffering down the line, but that's not something i wish to go into. \n\nmeanwhile, here are some practical tips to go from very low energy to very high energy (i.e., make yourself more restless), provided you have the desire to do so:\n\n- always be standing, or sleeping, rarely seated\n- no cozy furniture in your work room\n- always have something to fidget with at hand. ideally something that gets you moving. i have a tennis ball and a football\n- work out at low to moderate intensity multiple times a day, rarely high intensity\n- use breaks from work to do household chores. that'll keep you moving\n- eat lots of meat and eggs\n- make sure you're constantly stimulated in one way or another. this is crucial to building momentum\n- always have a list of things to do\n- mimic high energy people you know and you'll be high energy\n\n⚠️ disclaimer:\n\nonce your mind picks up momentum and starts buzzing, you'll need a productive desire to spend it on. otherwise it will definitely lead to more harm than good.\n\nan idle mind is a blessing, not the devil's workshop. but a restless mind without actionable desire or direction is certainly the devil's workshop."
