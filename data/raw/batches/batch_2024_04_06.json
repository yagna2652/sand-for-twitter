He took away my belief in science, he robbed me of the joy of explaining and ordering things, and he let devotion to the ideals of this time die out in me.\nHe forced me down to the last and simplest things.\n\nThe spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my knowledge and placed them at the service of the inexplicable and the paradoxical.\n\nHe robbed me of speech and writing for everything that was not in his service, namely the melting together of sense and nonsense, which produces the supreme meaning.\""

From the time we are small, it is something we are taught to build within ourselves. An... impenetrable wall, behind which we can retreat whenever we need. You must train yourself to listen without hearing. For instance, you can listen to the sound of a blossom falling or the rocks growing. If you really listen, your present circumstance vanishes. Do not be fooled by our politeness. Our bows, our maze of rituals. Beneath it all... we could be a great distance away. Safe. And alone.\"\n\nmaster krishnamurti talked about this listening and aloneness throughout his life, that too in pretty much the same words. it's a nondual teaching, not some silly \"compartmentalization\""
