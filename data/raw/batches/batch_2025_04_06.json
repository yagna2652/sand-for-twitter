      "content": "some nuance:\n\nforgiveness is not strictly a choice; there's a degree of self-realization where you start empathizing even with the vilest, cruelest, and meanest of people. and given enough context, you can very easily simulate why a particular individual acts in a certain way. you become increasingly compassionate.\n\nwith enough understanding of the mind, you will naturally develop compassion even for difficult people. so, forgiveness is more of an inevitable outcome than a deliberate moral decision. \n\nhowever, choosing to remain in someone's company or lending them support is entirely separate. worldy wisdom includes the ability to recognize harmful patterns and likely trajectories. you can understand someone completely while still deciding they don't deserve your presence or endorsement.\n\nsee clearly without judgment, yet act with judgment for yourself and others. this is responsibility.\n\nif op uses 'forgive' as what you actually do, then, \n\nchoosing to forgive without empathy is  following a bumper sticker.\n\nand choosing to *not forgive* is only possible with empathy. you can't really forgive someone if you can't put yourself in their shoes. it cannot be morally enforced without understanding.\n\nbut with enough self-awareness you can empathize with everyone, if not necessarily understand them. forgiveness is your default.\n\nfor example, i totally understand why my friend committed such treachery; i can see why he would act that way. but will we be friends again? nope. will i feel vengeful enough to go ahead and return him the favor? that depends.\n\nany action i take will not be from a place of ill will but of extreme and practical necessity. i will not hold any grudge towards this person. you can't when you understand huge parts of them quite viscerally, even though the contexts might be different. i will feel no personal animosity, yet still choose distance or even necessary counteraction.\n\nbecause we are fundamentally not different, but one of us understands himself just enough to be able to discern and *choose* differently.\n\ni see him, and i see myself in him, and i may clap back if i feel responsible enough or care enough, or i may not and just part ways for good.\n\nit is a deeply personal decision, yes, but i don't call it forgiveness; just worldly wisdom.\n\nself-realization is forgiveness by default. doesn't mean anything really if you only judge people by what they do: krishna's compassion for humanity made brothers fight and kill each other.\n\nforgiveness is a purely subjective state of mind that cannot be described in words. but what you do is purely rational and calculated statecraft. the source of those actions is truth, not greedy or fearful self-interest.\n\nthis is why the prime duty / dharma of a leader is to be the tao, because such a grave responsibility cannot be delegated to another."

Why is this even desirable?\"\n\nyes it does, but now you don't have a large majority of the \"moderates\" or \"innocent\" suffering because of it. in fact, if you were pragmatic enough about the whole thing, you'd actively give up that infamous label.\n\nyes, christians do not go on crusades anymore. but should we wait another 600 years and hope islam undergoes a similar transformation? or do you make that change today at an individual level and isolate yourself from all such ideology?"
